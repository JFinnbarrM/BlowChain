# Audioworm

This project aims to create a decentralised content distribution system designed for live events and environments. 

It uses a hybrid daisychain-like network topology between small low-energy devices to share files across very long distances. Each user device can receive the file through BLE communication protocols to trigger playback with visual effects (via a display or leds).

File acceptance requires a physical gesture from the user, detected through onboard sensors, to enhance interactivity and consent in participation.

User engagement data, such as time of interaction, can be logged and tracked in a blockchain, to enable data analytics for campaign managers or advertisers. This can be used to analyse and develop engagement and participation strategies.
